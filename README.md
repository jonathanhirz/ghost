# ghost: hunter

top down action/puzzle ghost game. #madewithunity

## GDD

- [x] Float around the map (slower)
- [x] You shoot humans with something, they die. Small ghost floats above their body
- [x] Humans spawning in to try and catch you
- [x] You float over and collect ghosts. They follow you like a tail
- [ ] If a small ghost touches a dead body on the ground, they come back to life and attack you (maybe as a zombie? Different attack pattern)
- [x] Either collect as many small ghosts you can in time limit, have a place to "deposit" ghosts you collect, high score before you die
- [ ] DONE
- [ ] later stuff: pickup that increases fire rate
- [ ] dream stuff: 2-4 player mode for Switch. Competetive. Kill humans, collect ghosts, reanimate bodies that will attack other ghost(s) for you
